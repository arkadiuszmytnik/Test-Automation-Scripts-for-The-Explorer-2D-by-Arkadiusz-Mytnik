Hello everyone!

I'm excited to share my C# automation scripts for testing the Unity game "The Explorer 2D." These scripts focus on verifying gameplay functionality and level progression, guiding the player character through all the necessary steps to complete the game:

Level traversal: Navigate seamlessly between different game areas.
Item collection: Pick up essential items like weapons and keys.
Obstacle destruction: Break down barriers and columns to progress.
Boss battle: Engage in and defeat the final boss encounter.
